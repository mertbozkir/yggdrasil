Based on the requirements for the Secure File Transfer System project, here is a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the stages to guide you through the development process. Each stage builds on the previous one, ensuring that all core features are implemented systematically.

---

### Project Stages

#### **Stage 1: Initial Setup and Planning**
- **Objective**: Lay the groundwork for the project.
- **Tasks**:
  - Review and understand the project requirements in detail.
  - Select a programming language and tools (e.g., Python with Scapy for packet manipulation).
  - Set up your development environment by installing necessary libraries (e.g., Scapy, PyCrypto for encryption, hashlib for hashing).
  - Initialize a Git repository for version control and create a project folder structure (e.g., for code, tests, and documentation).

---

#### **Stage 2: File Transfer System Development**
- **Objective**: Build the basic functionality to send and receive files over a network.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a simple client-server system using sockets (choose TCP or UDP based on your needs).
  - Implement manual packet fragmentation to split large files into smaller chunks.
  - Develop packet reassembly logic on the receiving end.
  - Add basic error detection (e.g., checksums) and correction (e.g., retransmission for lost packets).

---

#### **Stage 3: Security Mechanisms Implementation**
- **Objective**: Secure the file transfer process.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add **AES encryption** to protect file data during transmission.
  - Use **RSA** for client authentication and secure key exchange between the sender and receiver.
  - Implement **SHA-256 hashing** to verify the integrity of the transferred file.
  - Ensure only authenticated clients can send or receive files.

---

#### **Stage 4: Low-Level IP Header Processing**
- **Objective**: Manually handle IP packet headers for deeper network control.
- **Tasks**:
  - Use Scapy to manipulate IP headers, including:
    - Flags (e.g., Don’t Fragment).
    - TTL (Time to Live).
    - Checksum fields.
    - Fragmentation offsets.
  - Compute and verify IP checksums to detect transmission errors.
  - Ensure fragmented packets are correctly reassembled at the receiver.

---

#### **Stage 5: Network Performance Measurement**
- **Objective**: Evaluate the system’s performance under various conditions.
- **Tasks**:
  - Measure latency using tools like **ping** or custom round-trip time (RTT) calculations.
  - Assess bandwidth with **iPerf** to determine transfer speeds.
  - Simulate packet loss and congestion using **tc** (traffic control).
  - Compare performance across different setups (e.g., Wi-Fi vs. wired connections) and document the results.

---

#### **Stage 6: Security Analysis and Attack Simulation**
- **Objective**: Test the system’s security against potential threats.
- **Tasks**:
  - Use **Wireshark** to capture packets and confirm that encrypted data is unreadable.
  - Simulate attacks such as **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** and **packet injection**.
  - Verify that authentication and encryption protect against unauthorized access and data tampering.

---

#### **Stage 7: Testing and Debugging**
- **Objective**: Ensure the system works reliably and efficiently.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write **unit tests** for key components (e.g., encryption, fragmentation).
  - Perform **integration tests** to check that all parts function together smoothly.
  - Debug any issues using logs or debugging tools.
  - Validate the system under simulated network and security conditions.

---

#### **Stage 8: Documentation and Reporting**
- **Objective**: Document your work and prepare a final report.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add detailed comments to your code for clarity.
  - Write a comprehensive report including:
    - System design and architecture.
    - Details of how each feature was implemented.
    - Performance results (latency, bandwidth, etc.).
    - Security analysis with attack simulation outcomes.
  - Ensure the report is well-structured and meets all project guidelines.

---

#### **Stage 9: Final Review and Submission**
- **Objective**: Polish and submit the completed project.
- **Tasks**:
  - Review the code, tests, and documentation to ensure everything meets requirements.
  - Make final tweaks or fixes based on testing or feedback.
  - Submit the project, including the source code, documentation, and report.
